Driver Class-TestClient
The driver class of the program is TestClient were you can input GET,CREATE,DELETE,UPDATE along with Vehicles/Vehicles/{id}
in the console, and seperated by space. 
The JTest class does the Java unit testing for the underlying classes.
In the Driver class, when you enter the Vehicles/{id} route make sure to surround the id with {} parantehesis(example-{23}).
Thank you for giving me the opportunity for making this application! I hope that the solution is sufficient.
